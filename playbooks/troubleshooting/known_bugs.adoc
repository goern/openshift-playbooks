= [Bug 1256869] Deleting Users and Identity does not remove Authorization Settings

Issue: When you delete a user and their corresponding identity the policy and role bindings still remain.
Related to this, a user's group membership is also maintained.

To properly delete all user information:
-----------
oc delete user <user name>
oc delete identity <identity name>
oadm policy remove-user <user name>
oadm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user <user name>
-----------

If the user is a member of a group:

-----------
oadm groups remove-users <group name> <user name>
-----------
