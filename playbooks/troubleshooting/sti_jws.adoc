== Creating a JWS App secret - Prerequisite

In order to get a JWS app to build properly a JWS App Secret needs to exist.
If there isn’t a JWS certificate needed to build the app outside of STI then a substitute can be used. 
Otherwise you can use you own in the steps that follow.

* Get a copy of the JWS App Secret .json file from the JBoss Openshift Git repo:
  https://github.com/jboss-openshift/application-templates/blob/master/secrets/jws-app-secret.json
* Save the file locally on the OSE Master node. 
  If you have a JWS App Certificate and Key you can replace the “server.crt” and “server.key” lines.
* Execute the following command:

---------
  oc create -f <file you created above>
---------

* Add the Secret to the Builder ServiceAccount:

----
  oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secret/jws-app-secret
----


== Using a private repository

When using a Private Repo the Deploy Key needs to be available for the build process 
so it can execute a Git Clone command against the repo.

* If a key has not been created for the Master Node run the following command:

--------
ssh-keygen -t rsa
--------

* Use the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file to create a Deploy Key for the private repo
  This can be done through the UI for the repo by an admin
* Create a new Secret using the private key created above:

--------
  oc secrets new amgen-git ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa -n <project name>
--------

*Add the new secret to the Builder service account:

--------
 oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/amgen-git -n <project name>
--------
