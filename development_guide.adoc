= Solution Playbook Development Guide

== Playbook Parts

=== Presenter Guide

_As a Presenter, I want to have Documentation available to me which allows me to present a Demo of a particular solution in a canned environment._

A good Presenter Guide should…

* List prerequisite knowledge needed to understand the demo material, including resource links to help a presenter ramp up.
* Contain all execution steps needed to step through a successful demo
* Include some presenter notes that call out things to highlight, subject matter to cover

=== Implementer Guide
_As an Implementer, I want to have Documentation available to me which enables me to go and implement a particular solution in my own environment._

A good Implementer Guide should…

* Document Assumptions and Prerequisites
* Be Flexible - Call out options for alternate or customized approaches
* Be Specific - Include steps and code examples
* Be Opinionated - Don’t want to shy away from giving recommendations just because the approach may change later
* Should not overwrite docs - Complement and reference official documentation whenever possible
* Include diagrams where relevant
* Make it appropriate for Public eye

== Notes

* Playbooks may in the future be turned into Enablement material... think about how this could be turned into exercises
